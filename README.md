TITANIC
    Under the Titanic directory, My aim is to predict survivability of the Titanic Disaster by creating a predictive model.
    I aim to utilise some Machine Learning Techniques like:
        Data Preprocessing: 
            - Distribution sampling for NaN data
            - One Hot encoding
            - Experimenting with polynomial features
            -
